# Challenge 01: Binary Search Implementation

**Difficulty:** 🟡 Intermediate  
**Topics:** Search Algorithms, Arrays, Recursion

## 📖 Description

Implement the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement binary search algorithm
- Work with sorted arrays
- Return the index of the found element, or -1 if not found
- Understand time complexity O(log n)

## 📋 Requirements

1. Function should accept a sorted array and target value
2. Return the index of the target, or -1 if not found
3. Use the divide-and-conquer approach
4. Include both iterative and recursive solutions (bonus)

## 💡 Example

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test cases
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
print(binary_search(arr, 7))   # Output: 3
print(binary_search(arr, 15))  # Output: 7
print(binary_search(arr, 4))   # Output: -1
```

## 🌟 Bonus Points

- Implement both iterative and recursive versions
- Add edge case handling
- Compare performance between linear and binary search

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understand binary search algorithm
- Practice recursion
- Learn about time complexity
- Master array manipulation
