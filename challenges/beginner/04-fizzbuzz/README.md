# Challenge 04: FizzBuzz

**Difficulty:** 🟢 Beginner  
**Topics:** Loops, Conditionals, Logic

## 📖 Description

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but:
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use loops to iterate through numbers 1-100
- Apply conditional logic
- Print the correct output for each number

## 📋 Requirements

1. Loop from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
2. Check divisibility by 3, 5, and both
3. Print appropriate output for each case
4. Each output should be on a new line

## 💡 Example Output

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
```

## 🌟 Bonus Points

- Make it work for any range (e.g., 1 to N)
- Add custom rules (e.g., "Bazz" for multiples of 7)
- Create a function that accepts parameters

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Master loop structures
- Understand modulo operator
- Practice conditional statements
- Classic interview problem!
